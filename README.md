### TECHNOBOT : Conversational chatbot built in Python 

Building a intelligent-chatbot can sound daunting, but it’s totally doable. TECHNOBOT is the ML  powered conversational
dialog interface project built in Python. With this tool, it’s easy to create Natural Language conversational scenarios with some
awesome python builtin libraries  and coding efforts.
The smooth UI makes it effortless to create and train conversations to the bot and it continuously gets smarter as it learns from
conversations it has with people.
